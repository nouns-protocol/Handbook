title: Problem Statement
description: Identifies the key issues in DeFi markets, such as liquidity fragmentation and inefficient asset management.
---

In the rapidly evolving decentralized finance (DeFi) space, users face significant challenges in effectively managing and growing their digital assets. Despite the growth of DeFi platforms, several core issues remain:

1. **Fragmented Liquidity**: With assets spread across various chains and protocols, users struggle to efficiently allocate their liquidity. This fragmentation leads to missed opportunities for maximizing returns, as users can't easily access or manage assets across multiple chains in a unified way.
2. **Inefficient Asset Utilization**: Many DeFi users either hold idle tokens in wallets or use them inefficiently, resulting in lost potential gains. There is no streamlined mechanism that allows users to optimize the yield from their tokens, NFTs, or real-world assets (RWAs) across different platforms and chains.
3. **Complexity of Yield Optimization**: Navigating the DeFi landscape to maximize returns is highly complex, with users needing to monitor multiple platforms, rates, and strategies. Most users lack the time or expertise to track the best lending and borrowing opportunities across various chains, leaving them with suboptimal profits.
4. **Insecure Asset Storage**: Storing valuable digital assets, such as tokens and NFTs, on centralized platforms introduces security risks. The lack of decentralized, secure storage options exposes users to the possibility of hacks, theft, or loss of funds.
5. **Lack of Goal-Oriented Financial Tools**: Traditional DeFi platforms offer lending and borrowing options, but they often lack goal-setting features. Users have no way to strategically set financial targets, such as saving up for a specific asset or achieving a return by a certain date, in an automated and optimized manner.
